				<a id="Democracy-4" class="bookmark-link"><h5>Democracy 4</h5></a>
				
				<i>Democracy 4 is the ultimate sandbox for testing out your political ideas. We all think our politicians are useless and that we could do a better job ourselves, but is that really true? With one eye on the budget, one-eye on the polls, and somehow finding time to watch out for terrorist attacks at the same time, you will find that staying in power while changing society for the better is a tougher job than you ever imagined.</i><br>
				<br>
				Having previously delivered both innovative design and advanced engine programming for the Democracy franchise, I was asked to design and program its next major sequel, Democracy 4.<br>
				<br>
				The franchise would require major investment in both design and engine programming to create a game suitable for the demands of the contemporary market.<br>
				<br>
				I decided that the design pillars for the project would be to create:<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
				<li>a simulation capable of modelling politics across the world</li>
				<li>a scalable UI to uncap the complexity of the data being shown</li>
				<li>a fluid UI to tell compelling stories with data</li>
				<li>a rendering engine suitable for future display resolutions</li>
				</ul>
				I achieved this by taking what I had learned in broadening the simulation for Democracy 3: Africa and created a global simulation for Democracy 4.<br>
				<br>
				I uncapped the displayable data complexity by developing a state-of-the-art vector graphics rendering engine, utilising the Cairo open source library to dynamically rasterise SVG assets. Pixel-perfect UI elements can be created at any scale, allowing for a far greater density of information to be displayed. This also provides a crisp game interface on displays of any resolution.<br>
				<br>
				To make the UI fluid, I developed an animation engine that allows UI elements to continuously scale and move around the interface. I also developed UI containers that would automatically scale and space elements inside of them, using a unique pseudo-physical repulsor algorithm. Each UI element can be assigned a weight, and their size and location within a container will be determined based on the other elements within that container. Different heuristics are used to weight the neurons in the simulation's neural network, and they smoothly animate to their new sizes and positions within the UI.<br>
				<br>
				I wrapped the complexities of these low-level systems in a simple API, so that it would be easy to continue to develop Democracy 4 throughout its early access period.<br>

				<i>Democracy 3: Africa is the new standalone re-imagining of the hit political strategy game Democracy 3. Set entirely in countries on the continent of Africa, D3:A puts you in charge of these countries and challenges you to stay in power whilst fixing each country's problems, improving the quality of life for your electorate, and steering them towards greater prosperity.</i><br>
				<br>
				Democracy 3 was a global success, but only modelled the political systems of Western industrialised nations. There is a far broader spectrum of politics beyond these countries. I was tasked with developing a standalone simulation that would allow players to lead nations from across the continent of Africa.<br>
				<br>
				As lead designer, I selected ten African countries by deeply researching their politics, economics and histories. I chose these nations to represent the diversity of societies across the continent. Data sources included the UN, IMF, CIA World Factbook, Mo Ibrahim Foundation, Economist Intelligence Unit, Transparency International, World Bank, and WHO. These provided new, measurable dimensions for each candidate nation, and ultimately informed my design of a broader political simulation.<br>
				<br>
				To support the inclusion of significant additions to the original game's simulation, I worked throughout the code base to program new game systems.<br>

				<i>Have you ever wanted to be president or prime minister? Convinced you could do a better job of running the country? Let's face it, you could hardly do a worse job than our current political leaders. Crime, Unemployment, National Debt, Terrorism, Climate Change...Have you got the answers to the problems that face Western industrialized nations? Here is your chance to find out...</i><br>
				<br>
				Democracy 3 was a worldwide hit, demanding the game be translated from English into Simplified Chinese, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Polish and Portuguese. I was tasked with building an OS-strength text rendering engine to accurately display all translated text.<br>
				<br>
				To achieve this cross-platform, I compiled custom builds of the open source Pango-Cairo libraries for each target platform (Windows, macOS and Linux). These libraries shape UTF8 encoded vector characters and rasterise them to a data surface. I then wrote a custom texture packer, texture indexer and rendering engine to generate and display the rasterised text data. I successfully refactored my custom API into a mature code base that had previously used fixed-width, ASCII text rendering.<br>
				<br>
				There were initially two distinct code bases for Democracy 3: one written using the Windows API and DirectX, the other written for macOS and Linux using SDL and OpenGL. I extended the cross-platform code base to be compatible with Windows, so that a single code base and static data set could me maintained going forward.<br>

				<br>
				Huscarlas is a distillation of interesting game states found in the squad-tactics genre. Condensed tactical situations form mini puzzles that are algorithmically pieced together by an AI director. The director creates scalable, procedurally generated levels, to continually engage the player with new content.<br>

				<i>The dance hall is packed, and the dancers wait with anticipation for the conductor. Complex dance patterns are scribed across the floor. Only when the dancers have been expertly placed in their starting positions, can the party begin.</i><br>
				<br>
				Dance Duets is an accessible, infinitely scalable puzzle game. Players are challenged to match similarly coloured dancers across a network of pathways. The procedurally generated puzzles can scale to any arbitrary size to suit a player's skill. Additional puzzle complexity is introduced by including dynamic tiles with flip-flop output gates, and colour cycling functions.<br>
				<br>
				Players must keep the party going by completing a chain of puzzles. Successfully matched dancers are carried to the next dance floor, but the party is over when there are fewer matched dancers than mismatched.<br>

The entire jury must be sat in their seats to reach a consensus, brought together by the power of cake.</i><br>
				<br>
				Courtroom Cake is a puzzle game in which players must determine jurors' cake preferences. Jurors will like certain cakes, and dislike others. The attraction and repulsion fields exerted on each juror by the cakes around them must be	balanced, in order to position them at their seat. The whole jury must be located around the table for a decision to be made, and the case to conclude.<br>
				<br>
				Puzzles are generated procedurally, with complexity adjusted by modifying the number of jurors, cakes, and preferences per individual. Players compete to bring justice to as many cases as they can in a row, with the difficulty of the puzzles increasing with each successful verdict.<br>
